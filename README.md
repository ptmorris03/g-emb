# G-Emb 

## Description

This repository contains the code and data for a Python project that focuses on genomic and proteomic data analysis. The project uses Poetry for dependency management.

## Repository Structure

Here is the structure of the repository:

```
.
├── README.md               # This file
├── data                    # Data directory
│   ├── download_grch38.sh  # Bash script to download GRCh38 data
│   ├── genomes             # Genomic data
│   ├── proteins            # Proteomic data
│   └── transcripts         # Transcript data
├── gemb                    # Python package for the project
│   └── __init__.py         # Initialization file for the package
├── poetry.lock             # Lock file generated by Poetry
└── pyproject.toml          # Poetry configuration file
```

### Data Directory

- `genomes`: Contains genomic data in FASTA format (`grch38.fasta`) and its index (`grch38.fasta.fai`).
- `proteins`: Contains proteomic data in FASTA format (`grch38.fasta`) and its index (`grch38.fasta.fai`).
- `transcripts`: Contains transcript data in FASTA format (`grch38.fasta`) and its index (`grch38.fasta.fai`).

### Gemb Directory

- `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the Python package.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Poetry (for dependency management)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ptmorris03/g-emb.git 
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-repo
    ```

3. Install dependencies using Poetry:

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

## Usage

### Downloading Data

To download the GRCh38 data, navigate to the `data` directory and run the `download_grch38.sh` script:

```bash
cd data
bash download_grch38.sh
```

### Running the Code

You can import the `gemb` package in your Python scripts as follows:

```python
import gemb
```
